# Outfitary

A CRUD web app that serves as an imaginary wardrobe, allowing the user to create clothing items, and pair them together to create different outfits. This application utilizes the OpenAI Dall-E-3 model to generate clothing images based on the description and clothing type inputed by the user. Users are able to select different items and save outfit presets, as well as regenerate clothing images if they are not satisfied with the image for their item.
